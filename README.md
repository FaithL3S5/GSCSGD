# STREAM
This repo is the result of Team REVOLT's hard work on Gameloft Student Competition Series: Game Development.

Game Title: STREAM

Genre: Side Scrolling, Kayaking, Nature, Casual

Developed in: Unity 19, C# for Programming (Farishanif & FaithL3S5), Photoshop & Paint Tool SAI for Assets (Pra & FaithL3S5), FL Studio for Sound (RachmanHanafi)

Result: Top 5 position in Gameloft Student Competition Series: Game Development

Bear in mind, only one of us has touched Unity and still a novice on it (Pra). All of us are still very new in unity and yet we pulled through, but the game still have quite a lot of bugs. We proceed to make a new program instead of continuing the development of this game. Please do enjoy this simple game that we made with all of our hearts.
